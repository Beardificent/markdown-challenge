Hold your hair if you need to puke due to heavy workload stress.
I'll also buffer any ideas you wish to share or input, even if it's just pure logorrhea.[ยน]
I'm a great listener, just don't expect any great answers.

<h5>A funny story</h5>

![Alt Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beardificent/markdown-challenge/master/giphy-downsized.gif)

Few years back, when I was filled with youth's energy, full of untapped potential and the biggest hopes, I lived in Ekeren.
I didn't live in Ekeren alone, a few other cool cats lived around, and we tended to get together and drink beer and eat sandwiches.

On one of those occasians we decided to play a game which was called Pub Crawl and it had like these activity and hints cards,
these guys had me fooled that if you pulled an activity card you had to do the actual activity. 

I pulled a card that said "Go to the nightshop and ask for free beer" - which I did. While I came back they said they had already
played another round and it was my turn again, I had to draw another activity card and it was again a nightshop related thing, so off I went.
I had to get something for free again, which didn't pan out. Suddenly one of the guys from the get together entered the nightshop and said that he too had an activity to do.

Needless to say, at that time, I was relieved. Everyone had to go out and make a fool of himself. The guy said to take a picture together as that was his activity.
He said "say cheese" as we both looked into the camera, of a flip phone noone remembers, and then he flung his fist down, 
with a speed that not even The Flash can reach, making an arching motion right into my _nutsack_.

Years later, he's teaching me code stuff.

Thank you, **Sicco**.

<h6>TL;DR</h6>

Sicco punched me in the nuts.
